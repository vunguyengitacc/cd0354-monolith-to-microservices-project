Sorry for that but for now I cannot complete the step deployment at Travis

Because Travis requires International Credit Card to use their pipeline even in "FREE PLAN", but for now I don't have any Credit Card.
I ask my colleagues that have also done the project without Travis, they said that I could try the CI pipeline with Circle CI as a replacement for Travis.

After reading docs and watching some guidelines, I understand how these platforms works, knowing how to write a deployment yaml file and believing that I can apply this to my project in the future so hope that you can accept me to use CircleCI instead of Travis.

Thank you
